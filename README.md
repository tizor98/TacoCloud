# Taco Cloud App

Application to put orders in a fictitious Taco restaurant using `Spring framework`.

You can download the project and run it with `Maeven` commands.
You will find one branch for one specific topic or subproject of Spring Framework.
Thus, each branch is independent of one another.

This app was developed using `Java 11`. Folder structure follows the usual Java application structure using an MVC design pattern.
Therefore, main files are located in `src/main/java/com.local.tacocloud/` for the base code, and `src/main/resources` for static
and configuration files.

## Dependencies

- Spring Boot v2.7.7
- Thymeleaf as the view engine
- MongoDB v4.0.28
- Flapdoodle to create an embedded Mongo database
